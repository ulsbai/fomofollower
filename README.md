# Fomofollower

The fomofollower is a program that I made that drives a robot around to follow my red shirt. It uses an artificial intelligence model that I trained using [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com) and deployed as a C++ library. Currently it can drive a snap circuit rover and a Freenove Smart Car for Raspberry Pi.
